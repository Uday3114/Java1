27.	Is null a keyword in java?
	(no)

28.	What happens when you add a char value to a String?
	(the char int double float and boolean type data would be converted to a string and would be concatenated with the existing string and would be printed using toString())

31.	What happens when you add a float value to a String?

32.	What happens when you add a Boolean value to a String?

33.	Can we directly print objects?
	(no, rather than the object value getting printed , Object address gets printed as shown below)

34.	Can we directly print primitive data types?
	(yes)

35.	Does ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occur in case of immutable Strings? Why?
	(yes,if charAt() is used)

44.	Give the memory map for String s1 = “Rama”;(rama)

45.	Give the memory map for String s1 = “Rama”; s1.concat(“Sita”)(rama);

46.	Give the memory map for String s1 = “Rama”; s1=s1.concat(“Sita”);(ramasita)

64.	What are the three constructers of StringBuffer class?

65.	What is the default buffer size of the StringBuffer class?

66.	What is the role of append()?

70.	In which class is the toString() present?
	(Object class)

71.	What is the role of intern()?

72.	What is the role of StringTokenizer class?
	(chops a large string at a specified character and provides tokens)

73.	In which package is the StringTokenizer class present?
	(java.util)

74.	When was the StringBuilder class introduced in Java? 
	(jdk 1.5)

75.	Can we explicitly put a string object which is in the non-constant pool into the constant pool?
	(intern(), for the reverse operation there is no method)

76.	What is an immutable object?
	(An object whose state can never be changed is called an immutable object)

77.	What would happen if an immutable object is attempted for modification?
	(A copy of the object would be taken and would be modified whereas the original object would still remain immutable)

78.	Which exception is generated if we try to mutate an immutable object?
	(IllegalObjectStateException)

79.	Where does the string pool exist on the heap? 
	(permanent area)

80.	Is String class final in Java?
	(Yes)

81.	Why is char array preferred to store password in Java than a String? 
	(Passwords  are normally frequently modified hence it must be created either using the StringBuffer or the builder class or a char array can be used)

82.	Why is the String class final in Java? 
	(security reason, allows compiler to perform optimization, makes it easy to achieve thread safety,so that it cannot be subclassed)

83.	Is the String class thread safe?
	(Yes)

84.	Is StringBuffer class thread safe?
	(Yes)

85.	Is StringBuilder class thread safe?
	(No)

86.	What is the difference between declaring a String and defining a String?(Declaration- String s=new String() or String s=null;  Defining- String s = new String(“Rama”) or String s=”Rama”);
