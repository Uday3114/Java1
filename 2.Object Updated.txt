	(solution to real world problem needs oops approach,it is close to real world in which live)

33.	 When did the idea of object orientation emerge in the programming world?
	(in 1980â€™2 the it industry widely came to the conclusion that structured programming is not good style of pgmin hence object oreientation was adopted 
	as an alternative to structured programming.)

34.	What is the default value of an object reference declared as an instance variable?
