1.	When should an array data structure be used?
	(numerous data of same type has to be stored)

2.	What is an advantage of an array data structure?
	(creation is simple, storing data using loops is simple, accessing the stored data is simple)

3.	What is the disadvantage of an array data structure?
	(arrays demand contiguous memory, cant increase or decrease the size, can store only homogeneous data. All these [problems can be overcome using collections)

4.	Who creates arrays in Java and where? 
	(jvm creates on the heap)

5.	What are the different types of arrays in Java? 
	(1-d, 2-d, 3-d, …… n-d: regular and jagged)

6.	Design an array data structure to collect marks of 100 students of a class? 
	(int a[] = new int[100])

7.	Design an array data structure to collect marks of students in 5 classes each with 100 students? 
	(int a[][] = new int[5][100])

8.	Design an array data structure to collect marks of students in 3 schools each with 5 classes each with 100 students? 
	(int a[][][] = new int[3][5][100]) 

9.	Design an array data structure to collect marks of students in 3 schools with first school having 5 classes second school having 4 classes third school having 3 classes. 
	Number of students in each classes is given below

		First School
		Class	Number of students
		1	3
		2	4
		3	2
		4	1
		5	5

		Second School
		Class	Number of students
		1	1
		2	3
		3	4
		4	2

		Third School
		Class	Number of students
		1	2
		2	3
		3	4
	
	

10.	Design an array data structure to collect data of 3 Banks with following number of branches and customers.

		First Bank
		Branch	Number of Customer
		1	2
		2	1
		3	3
		4	5
		5	4

		Second Bank
		Branch	Number of Customer
		1	4
		2	1
		3	2
		4	3

		Third Bank
		Branch	Number of Customer
		1	3
		2	2
		3	4

11.	 What is the advantage of jagged array data structure? 
	(in real life the data is not regular rather it is jagged, therefore jagged array data structure represents the real world scenario much closely and better than the regular arrays)

12.	 Create an array of 5 person object? 
	(Person p[] = new Person[5])

13.	 What are the exceptions associated with arrays? 
	(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NegativeArraySizeException, ArrayStoreException)

14.	Can array be used without initialization? 
	(yes because it is created on the heap)

15.	Are arrays objects in Java? 
	(yes)
 
16.	What are the default values associated with an array?
	(depends on the data type.int,byte,short,long array-0; char-blank,float-0.0,boolean -false)

17.	Who deallocates memory of an array? 
	(garbage collector)

18.	Are arrays primitive data types? 
	(no they are objects)

19.	Can an array grow in size or shrink in size after they are created? 
	(no it does not grow and shrink in size during execution)

20.	What is the default value present in char array? 
	(\u0000)

21.	What is the default value present in objects array? 
	(null)

22.	What is meant by buffer overrun?
	(Attempt to access a memory location beyond the stipulated limit.) 

23.	What are most famous internet worms that were designed using buffer overrun? 
	(ans- Morris worm, code red worm, scammer worm.In java worms cannot be designed because exception occurs if any attempt is made to go beyond the array boundary)

24.	Does buffer overrun occur in java? Why? 
	(no, because java arrays are bound checked)

25.	Can 1-dimensional arrays be printed directly? 
	(no)

26.	Can 2-dimensional arrays be printed directly?
	 (no)

27.	What facility is available in java to directly print 1-dimensional arrays? 
	(loops)

28.	What facility is available in java to directly print 2-dimensional arrays? 
	(nested for loops)

29.	What facility is available in Java to directly print other user defined objects?
	(toString())
